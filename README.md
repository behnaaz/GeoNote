## Stack

This project is built on a MEAN stack (MongoDB with Mongoose, Express, Angular, and Node).

## Setup

Make sure you have Mongo installed. For help with that, see the [MongoDB installation guide](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/). Mongo should be running while you resume setup. Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install all the packages we need, and use `grunt serve` to run the server.

## Creating New Components

When making new components, use the [Yeoman Angular Fullstack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack). That will make things easier for you, and will preserve the structure of the project.
